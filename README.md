# MapUganda Handbook

## What is this?
This repository is an experiment in using a [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository—for the moment on [GitHub](https://github.com)—as an open-by-default tool for the [MapUganda](https://mapuganda.org) team.

It's intended to provide a single starting point for information, explanations, and resources needed to understand and manage our projects.

__"Open by default"__ means everything here is open to _the entire world_ unless there is a specific reason to restrict access (normally personally identifiable, sensitive, or private information). It is intended to be shared and collaboratively edited by anyone in or outside of the host organization.

### Why a Git repo?
Our hypothesis is that the fork-and-pull-request workflow of Git strikes a good balance between openness (anyone can fork and/or submit a pull request) and manageability (no one has to accept pull requests, and they're very transparent and reversible).

_Why not a Wiki?_ Mostly because we think that the Git style of forking, submitting pull requests, and discussing and merging changesets handles complex information in many formats better than Wiki editing. [Here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#wiki-handbooks-dont-scale) is a discussion of the advantages of a Git repo over a Wiki.

_Why not folders in Google Docs?_ Mostly because it becomes tricky to know where the "official final version" of some artifact is, certainly over time and with many collaborators. Some of us find it tricky to find the Google Doc we wrote last week, let alone one written by a former colleague in 2016.

However, nothing about this specifically prohibits—or even discourages—the use of Wikis or Google Docs. As long as the Handbook contains a link to the relevant Wiki or Doc, it's perfectly all right to use either.

We've taken some inspiration from [GitLabs' handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/); that company has taken a remarkably open approach to their internal workings, in part in response to some of the same challenges many of us at MapUganda have faced. 

## How does it work?
It's basically a Git repo full of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents (like the one you're reading right now) that explain projects and processes, and contain links to relevant resources. For a reader, it's not much different from a wiki; the difference lies in how edits are proposed, merged, tracked, and managed.

Of course, a Git repo can contain almost anything. Code, images, more sophisticated text formats like [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), reports (as PDF of Word documents), spreadsheets, slide decks, map projects and templates, and so on (though large files like videos don't live comfortably in Git repos, it's usually preferable to keep them outside of the tracked repo and link to them). We expect that in the fullness of time the contents of the repo will become more diverse than just Markdown and links; for instance we think having easy access to a the final report on a project (not just the PDF output) will be really helpful!

A lot of documents and information will still likely live in things like Google Drive/Docs. That's fine. The Markdown documents in the handbook serve as a guide and set of links to those resources (just as a Wiki would contain links to such assets). Over time it's probably a good thing if more documents may move into the actual Git repository itself, but it's not essential that this happen.

### How can I use it?
You need some familiarity with the basics of:
- Git: cloning, committing, forking/branching, creating pull requests, and merging.
- Markdown: Creating text with styling, links, and embedded images.

[Here are some learning resources for these tools](Resources/learning_resources.md).

#### Getting started by editing a page
- Click around the links available from this very page! Again, it looks and works like a Wiki; it's the editing that is different.
- Get an account on GitHub (free to sign up).
- Clone this repository. Open it up in your file manager on your computer; you'll note that the folder structure mirrors the link structure (you can figure out where any document in the repo is by examining the URL of the link to it).
- Pick a document you want to modify.
- Fork the repo.
- Make your changes to the page (Markdown document) you want to improve.
- Submit a pull request with explanation of your changes. Once it's accepted, congratulations: you are now a co-creator of the handbook.
  - Later you may be given commit privileges to the handbook, meaning you can be one of the people authorized to commit to the main branch of repo, and therefore accept (merge) pull requests (note that it's often considered a best practice to make a pull request and get someone else to merge it to main, even if you are technically able to directly commit changes to main unilaterally).

#### Getting started by creating a project
- Clone this repository. Open it up in your file manager on your computer; you'll note that the folder structure mirrors the link structure (you can figure out where any document in the repo is by examining the URL of the link to it).
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new textfile with a name like my_project.md (.md is the Markdown file extension).
- Glance at the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to remind yourself how to create nicely formatted text with headers, links, etc. Write an explanation of your project.
- Add a short high-level explanation of the project's main focus and goal(s). If a detailed publicly-accessible document already exists elsewhere, add a link to it.
- Try to add links to everything someone trying to manage the project would need.
  - The original project proposal and budget.
  - These may be private documents (the budget probably is). No problem; as long as the permissions _on the documents themselves_ are correctly set, the link won't help anyone who doesn't already have permission.
  - A section naming key people and their roles. For example, who is the donor/client point of contact? Who is the field team leader? Who is the HQ lead?
    - If this information should not be public, the easiest thing may be simply to put it in a Google Doc shared only with those authorized to see or edit it, and put a link to that doc in the Markdown. This way everyone will know where the document is (helpful for those who should have access to it but may not remember where it's saved; now they have a link labelled something like ```List of key stakeholders```) but only the authorized can actually read or edit it.
